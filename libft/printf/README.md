# 42_printf

<div align="center">

The goal of this project is pretty straightforward. You will recode printf(). You will mainly learn about using a variable number of arguments. How cool is that?? It is actually pretty cool :)

## 1. Challenges
<h3>The biggests challenges in ft_printf recode function, in my opinion, are three:</h3>

### 1. Understanding **variadic functions** (functions that receives an variable number of arguments);

- https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/variadic-functions-in-c/


### 2 . Understanding stdarg.h library, create structs witch contains pointers to the arguments received, and implement the logic depending in each kind of variable argument type;

### 3 . Last but not least, understand about conversion, flags, width precision and cspdiuxX%.

## I created a board to help undestanding

## 2. Most important steps

### 2.1 Read printf3 manual;

- https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/printf.3.html

### 2.2 Organize your schedule;

### 2.3 Test a LOT!

### 2.4 Deal with Makefile integration with Libft!
